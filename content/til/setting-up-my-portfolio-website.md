### spoiler: sparse files / holes in a file

I was recently going through the book *The Linux Programming Interface* and came across the concept of sparse files. Files are stored on multiple blocks on a disk and sparse files is a smart optimisation that skips allocating disk block if there is no data to be stored. 

You can create holes in your files by moving the file pointer `n` bytes ahead than the actual size and then write some random data to it.

TODO: add a small C snippet here on how to make sparse files.
