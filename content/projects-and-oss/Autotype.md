Does exactly what the name says!

This started as a small CLI script I wrote out of frustation from my college's assessment portal. The issue was we had to do very long coding assigments on the portal and it was very laggy, with no copy-paste enabled and wasted a lot of time for me and my peers to get a solution working and tests passing on that portal. 

The solution was to code solutions on your local and then autotype it on the portal, and this is how Autotype was born. It got quite popular because everyone was equally troubled by the laggy portal, hence the stars and forks!
